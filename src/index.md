**Plexus** is a [Rust library](https://crates.io/crates/plexus) for polygonal
mesh processing. It provides primitives, generators, buffers, and graphs that
are generic over their geometry. Plexus provides support for types from the
[`cgmath`](https://crates.io/crates/cgmath),
[`mint`](https://crates.io/crates/mint), and
[`nalgebra`](https://crates.io/crates/nalgebra) crates.

!!! warning
    Plexus is still in its initial development phase. Crates published to
    [https://crates.io](https://crates.io) in the `0.0.x` series do **not** obey
    [SemVer](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html)
    and are unstable. Dependencies should select an exact version until the
    public API is stabilized in the `0.1.x` series.

Unlike many other mesh processing libraries, Plexus avoids exposing low-level
topological operations such as inserting individual vertices into a graph.
These kinds of operations are easily performed incorrectly and often require
manual verification. Instead, Plexus exposes more abstract operations that
maintain topological consistency while being agnostic to geometry. Graphs are
manipulated in a way that is more similar to 3D modeling software, for example.
