Plexus provides a flexible representation of meshes as a [half-edge
graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/doubly_connected_edge_list) via the `graph`
module and `MeshGraph` type. Graphs can store arbitrary geometric data
associated with any topological structure. Unlike generators, iterator
expressions, and buffers, graphs provide efficient traversals and complex
manipulation of meshes.

Geometry is vertex-based, meaning that geometric operations depend on vertex
geometry exposing some notion of positional data via the `AsPosition` trait. If
geometry does not have this property, then geometric operations will not be
available. Read more about geometric traits [here](../geometry).

!!! note
    Plexus refers to _half-edges_ as _arcs_. This borrows from graph theory,
    where _arc_ typically refers to a directed adjacency.

`MeshGraph`s can be created from [buffers](../buffers) and
[generators](../generators).

```rust
// Create a graph of a two-dimensional quadrilateral from raw buffers.
let mut graph = MeshGraph::<Point2<R64>>::from_raw_buffers(
    vec![Quad::new(0usize, 1, 2, 3)],
    vec![(0.0, 0.0), (1.0, 0.0), (1.0, 1.0), (0.0, 1.0)],
)
.unwrap();

// Create a graph with positional data from a unit cube.
let mut graph = Cube::new()
    .polygons_with_position()
    .collect<MeshGraph<Point3<f64>>>();
```

## Representation

A `MeshGraph` is conceptually composed of _vertices_, _arcs_, _edges_, and
_faces_. The figure below summarizes the connectivity in a `MeshGraph`.

![Half-Edge Graph Figure](../img/heg.svg)

Arcs are directed and connect vertices. An arc that is directed toward a vertex
$A$ is an _incoming arc_ with respect to $A$. Similarly, an arc directed away
from such a vertex is an _outgoing arc_. Every vertex is associated with exactly
one _leading arc_, which is always an outgoing arc. The vertex toward which an
arc is directed is the arc's _destination vertex_ and the other is its _source
vertex_.

Every arc is paired with and connected to an _opposite arc_ with an opposing
direction. Given an arc from a vertex $A$ to a vertex $B$, that arc will have an
opposite arc from $B$ to $A$. Such arcs are typically notated $\vec{AB}$ and
$\vec{BA}$. Together, these arcs form an _edge_, which is not directed. An edge
and its two arcs are together called a _composite edge_.

Arcs are connected to their neighbors, known as _next_ and _previous arcs_. A
traversal along a series of arcs is a _path_. A path is _closed_ if it forms a
loop and is _open_ if it terminates. The path formed by traversing from an arc
to its next arc and so on is an _interior path_. When a face is present within
an interior path, the arcs will refer to that face and the face will refer to
exactly one of the arcs in the interior path. An arc with no associated face is
known as a _boundary arc_. If both of an edge's arcs are boundary arcs, then
that edge is a _disjoint edge_.

Together with vertices and faces, the connectivity of arcs allows for efficient
traversals of topology. For example, it becomes trivial to find neighboring
topologies, such as the faces that share a given vertex or the neighboring faces
of a given face.

!!! warning
    The `MeshGraph` data structure has some limitations. Only
    [orientable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/orientability) compact
    [manifolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/surface_(topology)) can be
    represented. Unorientable manifolds such as a [MÃ¶bius
    strip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/m%C3%B6bius_strip) and non-manifold
    structures such as edge fans cannot be modeled using `MeshGraph`.

`MeshGraph`s store topological data using associative collections and mesh data
is accessed using keys into this storage. Keys are exposed as strongly typed and
opaque values, which can be used to refer to a topological structure.

## Topological Views

`MeshGraph`s expose _views_ over their topological structure (vertices, arcs,
edges, and faces). Views are obtained using keys or iteration and behave
similarly to references. They provide the primary API for interacting with a
`MeshGraph`'s topology and geometry. There are three types of views summarized
below:

| Type      | Traversal | Exclusive | Geometry  | Topology  |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Immutable | Yes       | No        | Immutable | Immutable |
| Mutable   | Yes       | Yes       | Mutable   | Mutable   |
| Orphan    | No        | No        | Mutable   | N/A       |

_Immutable_ and _mutable views_ behave similarly to references: immutable views
cannot mutate a graph and are not exclusive while mutable views may mutate both
the geometry and topology of a graph but are exclusive. This example uses a view
to traverse a graph:

```rust
// Create a graph with positional data from a unit cube.
let mut graph = Cube::new()
    .polygons_with_position()
    .collect::<MeshGraph<Point3<f64>>>();

// Get a view of a face and its opposite face.
let face = graph.faces().nth(0).expect("cube");
let opposite = face
    .into_arc()
    .into_opposite_arc()
    .into_next_arc()
    .into_next_arc()
    .into_face()
    .expect("cube");
```

_Orphan views_ are similar to mutable views in that they may mutate the geometry
of a graph, but they do not have access to the topology of a graph. Because they
do not know about other vertices, arcs, etc., orphan views cannot traverse a
graph in any way. These views are most useful for modifying the geometry of a
graph and, unlike mutable views, are not exclusive.
[_Circulators_](#circulators), which are iterators over topological structures
in a graph, sometimes emit orphan views.

```rust
// Create a graph with positional data from a UV-sphere.
let mut graph = UvSphere::new(8, 8)
    .polygons_with_position()
    .collect::<MeshGraph<Point3<f64>>>();

// Scale the position data in all vertices.
for mut vertex in graph.orphan_vertices() {
    vertex.geometry *= 2.0;
}
```

Immutable and mutable views are both represented by view types, such as
`FaceView`. Orphan views are represented by orphan view types, such as
`OrphanFaceView`.

## Circulators

Topological views allow for traversal of a graph's topology. One useful type of
traversal uses a _circulator_, which is a type of iterator that examines the
neighbors of a topological structure. For example, the face circulator of a
vertex yields all faces that share that vertex in order.

Circulators allow for both immutable and mutable iteration. Mutable circulators
emit orphan views, because mutable views require exclusive access. To mutate
topology using multiple mutable views, use an immutable circulator to collect
the keys of the target topology and then lookup each mutable view using those
keys.

```rust
// Create a graph with positional data from a unit cube.
let mut graph = Cube::new()
    .polygons_with_position()
    .collect::<MeshGraph<Point3<f64>>>();

// Collect the keys of the faces in the graph.
let keys = graph
    .faces()
    .map(|face| face.key())
    .collect::<ArrayVec<[_; 6]>>();
for key in keys {
    // Get a mutable face view for each key.
    // Poke each face and translate the centroid along the face's normal.
    let _ = graph.face_mut(key).expect("independent").poke_with_offset(0.5);
}
```

Circulators generally begin iteration from a leading arc and then traverse
topology in a deterministic order from that arc.
