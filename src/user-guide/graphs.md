Graphs can be traversed and manipulated using _views_, which behave as cursors
and references into graph data. Many topological mutations yield views into the
modified mesh data, allowing code to operate over a mesh using nothing more than
graph traversals.

### Poking Faces in a Graph

This example forms a "spikey cube" using a graph. A generator is used to produce
positional data representing a cube as a stream of polygons. Those polygons are
collected into a graph and then each face is poked, forming a triangle fan about
a centroid vertex that is translated along the normal.

```rust
use arrayvec::ArrayVec;
use nalgebra::Point3;
use plexus::graph::MeshGraph;
use plexus::prelude::*;
use plexus::primitive::cube::Cube;

// Create a graph with positional data from a unit cube.
let mut mesh = Cube::new()
    .polygons_with_position()
    .collect::<MeshGraph<Point3<f64>>>();

// Collect the keys of the faces in the graph.
let keys = graph
    .faces()
    .map(|face| face.key())
    .collect::<ArrayVec<[_; 6]>>();
for key in keys {
    // Poke each face and translate the centroid along the face's normal.
    let _ = graph.face_mut(key).unwrap().poke_with_offset(0.5);
}
```

### Subdividing Faces in a Graph

This advanced example defines a function that subdivides a face in a graph. This
is accomplished using only views; the originating `MeshGraph` is not required to
implement the function. The function is generic over geometry and uses geometric
traits in its type bounds.

```rust
use plexus::geometry::alias::VertexPosition;
use plexus::geometry::compose::EdgeMidpoint;
use plexus::geometry::convert::AsPosition;
use plexus::geometry::Geometry;
use plexus::graph::{FaceView, MeshGraph};
use plexus::prelude::*;
use smallvec::SmallVec;

pub fn circumscribe<G>(face: FaceView<&mut MeshGraph<G>, G>) -> FaceView<&mut MeshGraph<G>, G>
where
    G: EdgeMidpoint<Midpoint = VertexPosition<G>> + Geometry,
    G::Vertex: AsPosition,
{
    // Split each edge, stashing the vertex key and moving to the next arc.
    let arity = face.arity();
    let mut arc = face.into_arc();
    let mut splits = SmallVec::<[_; 4]>::with_capacity(arity);
    for _ in 0..arity {
        let vertex = arc.split_at_midpoint();
        splits.push(vertex.key());
        arc = vertex.into_outgoing_arc().into_next_arc();
    }
    // Split faces along the vertices from each arc split.
    let mut face = arc.into_face().unwrap();
    for (a, b) in splits.into_iter().perimeter() {
        face = face.split(ByKey(a), ByKey(b)).unwrap().into_face().unwrap();
    }
    // Return the terminating face of the decomposition.
    face
}
```
